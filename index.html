            <h1>Central Bank Intervention and Securities:</h1>
            <h2>Investigating the Connection</h2>
            <p>This project aims to investigate the impact of central bank intervention, specifically by the Federal Reserve, 
              on securities like the DXY and US10Y. Using techniques including data visualization, machine learning, and regression analysis, we will analyze the effects of FOMC actions 
              and jawboning speeches. Our findings will provide insights into the effectiveness of these interventions and help to determine which has the greatest influence on 
              financial markets and economic policy. This project will be reviewed by

            <h1>The Federal Reserve and the USD:</h1>
            <h2>A Dominant Force in Global Financial Markets</h2>
            <p>The first chart illustrates the distribution of global foreign exchange reserves among the US Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen. The Dollar has consistently held the largest 
              share, averaging around 63%. The second chart displays the performance of the US Dollar Index (DXY) and 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (US10Y), securities that are heavily 
              impacted by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. By analyzing the effects of FOMC actions and jawboning speeches, we can assess the impact of these interventions on 
              financial markets and economic policy.</p>

            <h1>Impact of FOMC Actions on the DXY and US10Y</h1>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>This analysis examines the impact of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) actions on securities such as the DXY and US10Y. The first chart presents the Federal Funds Rate 
              from 2000 to 2022, including significant rate hikes and cuts. The second chart displays the DXY and US10Y rates from 2000 to 2022, filtered to only show intraday % changes 
              on FOMC dates. These charts demonstrate the power of FOMC actions to influence the performance of securities and shape market expectations. For instance, the 100bps rate 
              cut on December 16, 2008, resulted in an intraday decrease in the DXY and US10Y by -1.71% and -6.32% respectively. Data for these charts was obtained from FRED as an API 
              for the Federal Funds Rate, and from a table on Forbes Advisor for FOMC dates, which was then scraped and sorted using

            <h1>Jawboning and its Effect on the DXY and US10Y</h1>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>This analysis examines the effects of jawboning, or the use of verbal communication to influence market expectations, on securities such as the DXY and US10Y. The first 
              chart presents a timeline of jawboning speeches by Fed Chairs from 2000 to 2022, with different icons representing different speech types. The second chart displays the 
              DXY and US10Y rates from 2000 to 2022, filtered to only show intraday % changes on the days of these speeches. These charts show the influence of jawboning on the 
              performance of these securities and market expectations, due to key words or themes that can be speculative to many market participants. The data for these charts was 
              obtained from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Yahoo Finance, and FRED, and was filtered and sorted using Excel.</p>

            <h1>FOMC vs Jawboning:</h1>
            <h2>A Comparative Analysis</h2>
            <p>The analysis of the MSE and R-squared values for the FOMC and Speeches Models revealed that the latter was a better fit for the data, with a higher R-squared value of -0.122 
              and a lower MSE of 11.667. A regression analysis was then conducted to compare the impact on the DXY and US10Y, showing that the DXY had a higher R-squared of 0.0172 compared 
              to the US10Y R-squared of 0.00047. These findings suggest that jawboning speeches may have a significant impact on the DXY, however it is important to note that there are 
              numerous other factors that can influence the performance of these securities, and the analysis should not be taken as conclusive evidence. To conduct this analysis, the 
              CSV files for the FOMC dates and jawboning speeches were imported and

              <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wkaks8aUNvDUa7WujGqQrl2Cs2HFw9pk?usp=sharing">Regression</a> codes were run using Python in Google Colab. It's worth noting that 
              the US10Y data was often regarded as extreme values due to its volatility and sensitivity to FOMC and speeches.</p>

            <h1>Central Bank Intervention and Securities:</h1>
            <h2>A Comprehensive Summary</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, this project has provided an in-depth analysis of the relationship between Central Bank intervention by the Federal Reserve and securities such as the DXY 
              and US10Y. Through the analysis of FOMC actions and Jawboning speeches, we have evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions and determined that Jawboning speeches 
              may have a significant impact on the performance of the DXY. It is worth noting that there are many other factors that can also influence the performance of these securities, 
              as demonstrated by the FOMC's impact on the US10Y during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100bps rate cut in December 2008. Further study could examine the impact of other 
              central banks such as the Bank of Japan and the use of other forms of intervention, such as quantitative easing, on financial markets and securities.</p>
